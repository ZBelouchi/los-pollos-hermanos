# los-pollos-hermanos
A landing page for the fictional restaurant 'Los Pollos Hermanos' from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul for my front-end portfolio.

Following the show's set and prop design I decided to go with a flashy and bright design.
This also allowed for more expression and complex style concepts, where modern designs are minimalist and straightforward.

Note: there is no back-end so the career page won't actually do anything, but the entered info is taken in and printed to the console.
